# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To run the file, follow these steps:

Open the app.jsx file.
Launch the terminal.
Ensure that the paths shown on the right side are correct.
Type npm run dev in the terminal and hit Enter.
Once the server is running, you'll see a link with localhost:5173 or similar. Copy that link.
Open any web browser and paste the copied link into the address bar.
Press Enter to load the application.
